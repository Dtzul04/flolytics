# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute! Quick dev setup:

- Use Java 21 for local development (see `backend/README.md`).
- Use the Maven wrapper in `backend/mvnw` to build and run tests.
- Follow existing code style. An `.editorconfig` is provided.

Create a branch with a descriptive name and open a pull request against `main`.
