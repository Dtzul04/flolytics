# Flolytics

# Project Overview
Flolytics is a web application project focusing on frontend development. The project is designed to later integrate AI-powered features through a backend. Currently, it consists of a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Frontend
The frontend is fully functional and includes:
- `index.html` – Main HTML page.
- `style.css` – Styling for the application.
- `app.js` – JavaScript logic for interactivity (chat, UI features, etc.).

## Future Plans
- Set up a Python backend (Flask or FastAPI) to handle AI functionalities.
- Integrate AI models for chat, analysis, or other intelligent features.
- Connect the backend with the current frontend for a full-stack application.

## Running the Frontend
You can run the frontend using any live server extension (like VS Code Live Server) or by opening `index.html` directly in a web browser.
